# Brief format

The shape of `.brief/brief.md` — the product charter and the **single home** of the Definition of Done. One file per project; the slowest-changing artifact (1.2.1 touches it only on greenfield, brownfield first contact, or a discovery-surfaced project-level shift). It holds only what is **durable across sprints**: if a line would change next sprint, it belongs in `.sprint`/`.stories`/`.adr`/`.spec`, not here.

## File

`.brief/brief.md`. Headings exactly as in the template, in this order, so anchors like `.brief/brief.md#definition-of-done` and `#quality-goals` resolve. Sections are all required.

# {Product name}

## Vision
{the durable why this product exists}

## Problem
{the standing problem this product solves}

## Target users
{who this is for}

## Value proposition
{the edge over alternatives}

## Principles
- **{Stance}** — {how this product resolves a recurring trade-off}{; where a Quality goal enforces it, name that goal — never the bound}.
{2–5 items}

## North-star metric
**{Metric}** — {what it measures and why it's the one number that matters}. {definition only}

## Quality goals
- **{Guardrail name}** — {one bar, one measurable bound, threshold inline}.
{≥3 distinct bars; aim for 3–5, but never pack two bars to fit}

## Non-goals
- {What this product will never do}

## Definition of Done
A change is done when:
- {Per-PR criterion — judgeable against one PR as it lands.}

Outcome criteria (judged across the sprint, not one PR):
- {Outcome criterion — e.g. the sprint's intent still serves the north-star. Lives here when it can't be checked against a single PR, so the fact isn't dropped.}
```

## Field rules

| Section | Rule |
|---|---|
| Frontmatter | `last_reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD` only — set to today on every deliberate review, including a no-change one (distinguishes "checked, still true" from stale). No `version`, `status`, `author`, or `previous` — the Brief is **not** on a versioned lifecycle. |
| Vision | One sentence. The durable "why this exists." No elaboration. |
| Problem | The standing problem, in durable form. This sprint's problem lives in `.sprint/sprint-v{N}.md`. |
| Target users | One line. No persona dossier. |
| Value proposition | Tight: the edge — what they get here they can't easily get elsewhere. |
| Principles | 2–5 durable product tenets — standing stances on recurring trade-offs (privacy vs personalisation, correctness vs latency, reversibility vs speed). Product-level only: a technology choice is an `ADR-###`; a dev-process stance is not a product tenet. A captured `ADR-###` is checked against these (1.2.4) — flag, don't restate. When a principle's stance is also enforced by a Quality goal (e.g. a privacy stance and a privacy bound), the principle gives only the stance + its scope and **names** that goal as where the measurable edge lives — it never restates the bound (the Quality goal is its single home, exactly as the DoD never restates one). A reviewer at 4.2.2 reads the stance from here and the number from the goal — so the canonical home is never ambiguous. |
| North-star metric | The **definition** only — what it measures and why it's the one number. Never a period target ("1M users by Q4" is banned shape) and never a guardrail list — a metric that must not regress while chasing it is a Quality goal (with its bound), not a line here. The definition feeds the 1.1.1 intent check and 1.2.4 ADR check. |
| Quality goals | The **single home** of every standing quality bar — quality attributes as measurable **guardrails** (arc42 §1.2), standing through sprints. **One bar = one named line, one bound** ("p95 < 200ms on the production dataset", "zero silent failures", "recovery ≤ 5 minutes") — never two distinct bounds on one line (the second loses its name and stops being judgeable). The bar's name and its number are never split apart, north-star guardrails included: a metric that must not regress while chasing the north-star is one of these distinct bars, listed here with its bound, never under North-star. **Aim for 3–5; the single-home mandate wins the tie** — when distinct standing bars (north-star guardrails folded in) exceed 5, the count of *distinct* bars governs, never the cap: list every one as its own line, don't pack two to fit. (Above ~6, that is itself a signal the product carries too many standing bars — surface it, don't bury it.) These are injected verbatim into architect prompts (2.2.1) and reviewer briefs (4.2.2) and gate the DoD's no-regress criterion (5.2.4); write each so an agent can judge a change against it with no further context. |
| Non-goals | Standing exclusions — what this product will *never* do. Not sprint scope ("we won't build X this sprint" → `.sprint`). |
| Definition of Done | The canonical project-wide DoD, the **single home** of this fact, applied per-PR at acceptance (5.2.4) and confirmed at plan close-out (1.3.1). Two parts: **per-PR criteria** ("a change is done when…", judgeable against one PR — the per-PR DoD is the project DoD applied to what that PR delivers), and **outcome criteria** judged across the sprint (e.g. the intent still serves the north-star) — keep these in their own list so a real DoD fact that can't be checked against one PR is *recorded*, never silently dropped. The no-regress criterion points at Quality goals for its thresholds (their single home) — it never restates a bound. |

## What does not belong

- Sprint goal, scope, success metric → `.sprint/sprint-v{N}.md`
- User-facing wants → `US-###` in `.stories`
- Decisions and their trade-offs (incl. technology choices) → `ADR-###` in `.adr`
- How the system is actually built → `.spec/spec.md`
- Exploration notes, per-feature detail — anything that changes per sprint

## Editing

Living but scarce. A **content** edit is a strategic shift — vision, users, value proposition, principles, north-star, quality goals, non-goals, DoD — and pairs with an `ADR-###` carrying the why. Everything else is a typo fix in place. Either way, bump `last_reviewed`.

# Relay

## Vision
Every webhook a small team sends arrives exactly once — or they can see exactly why it didn't.

## Problem
Teams that emit webhooks rebuild the same delivery machinery — retries, signing, dead-lettering, receiver debugging — badly, on every project, and failures stay silent and unexplainable.

## Target users
Backend teams of 1–10 shipping APIs that must notify third-party receivers.

## Value proposition
Drop-in delivery with full per-event forensics, self-hosted: managed competitors offer delivery or visibility, never both without taking custody of payload data.

## Principles
- **Self-hosted over convenient** — payloads never leave the operator's infrastructure, even when a managed feature would be easier to build; the No-leak guardrail below is the measurable edge of this — it covers payload bytes, not delivery metadata, which Relay may relay through its own update channel.
- **Explainable over silent** — every delivery outcome is reconstructable from stored evidence; no fire-and-forget path exists.
- **Correctness over latency** — a delayed delivery beats a duplicate one; idempotency and ordering win ties.

## North-star metric
**Explained-delivery rate** — the share of events that either arrive (acknowledged 2xx) or carry a complete failure trace. It is the one number because both halves of the value proposition — delivery and forensics — degrade it when they slip.

## Quality goals
- **Delivery latency** — p95 enqueue-to-first-attempt must not exceed 2s at 1k events/min.
- **No silent failure** — every terminal event state writes a trace record; zero terminal states without one.
- **No leak** — payload bytes never cross infrastructure the operator doesn't run; checked at every storage and egress path.
- **Crash durability** — a node crash loses no accepted event (at-least-once across restarts).
- **Time to first delivery** — a fresh operator reaches first delivery from a single binary in under 15 minutes.

## Non-goals
- We will never store or relay payloads through infrastructure we operate.
- No general-purpose message queue — webhooks out, nothing else.
- No billing or seat logic in the core; monetisation lives outside this codebase.

## Definition of Done
A change is done when:
- Every acceptance criterion of its tickets passes on the code as it lands.
- The build-order Verify command passes on the landing tip.
- New behaviour carries tests; fixed behaviour carries a regression test.
- No Quality goal above regresses — measured at its stated threshold where a check exists, argued where not.
- `.spec/spec.md` reflects the change as landed.
- Any new dependency or externally visible contract change has an `ADR-###` recording the choice.

Outcome criteria (judged across the sprint, not one PR):
- The sprint's landed change leaves Explained-delivery rate no worse than its pre-sprint reading.
